# Stand Proposal & Contract — Changes for Review

*Feb 24, 2026*

---

## What Changed and Why

Lauren is earlier than we originally scoped. The product can't be defined with rigid deliverables yet. Instead of committing to 5 specific features with a day-by-day plan, we're restructuring the engagement around **dedicated time** — Andy (40 hrs/week) and David (6 hrs total) — at the same **$10K capped price**.

In practice: set up the infrastructure, collaborate daily, ship multiple versions of the app, and iterate until we land on something she's happy with. Like being an embedded teammate, not a contractor handing off a spec.

## Proposal — Key Changes

### Removed
- The 5 numbered deliverables (Stand Coach, Grand Reveal, Parent Gate, Printify, Admin Dashboard)
- Day-by-day sprint schedule (Day 1: do X, Day 2: do Y...)
- "What You'll Have" checklist (12 items)
- "Pilot Research Outputs" table
- Detailed infrastructure costs for services we may not use (S3, Recraft)

### Added
- **Architecture paragraph** in Basecamp — strong but flexible foundation lets us iterate quickly and commit to the right services, UX, and UI without sacrificing professional quality or user safety
- **"The Direction"** — loose list of what we're building toward (onboarding, AI branding, product integration, shareable output, parent gate, analytics, infrastructure) explicitly framed as *not* fixed deliverables
- **Simplified phases** — Alignment → Infrastructure → Build & Iterate → Polish & Ship
- **"After the Sprint"** rewritten as three paths: continued sprints, retainer, or handoff

### Unchanged
- Basecamp framing and research summary
- $10K price, 50/50 payment split
- What I Need From You section
- Daily check-in + MWF product session rhythm

## Contract — Key Changes

**Before:** 11 numbered deliverables with specific feature descriptions
**After:** Time-based services description — "product engineering (40 hrs/week) + senior engineering (6 hrs total), features determined collaboratively." Explicit language: *"This is a time-based engagement with a fixed price cap, not a fixed-deliverable contract."*

### Section 2 (Exclusions)
**Before:** 8 specific exclusions (Printify fulfillment, custom domains, CEO Dashboard, curriculum, social features, voice input, ongoing maintenance, out-of-scope work)
**After:** 3 exclusions (payment processing, ongoing maintenance, third-party costs)

### Section 8 (Cancellation)
**Before:** "If more than 50% of deliverables are complete" → full fee due
**After:** "If more than 50% of the sprint duration has elapsed" → full fee due

### Unchanged
- Compensation ($10K, 50/50 schedule)
- Timeline (14 days, day-for-day extension for client delays)
- IP assignment (upon full payment)
- Warranty (7-day bug fix window)
- Limitation of liability
- Independent contractor status

## Maintenance SLA

**No changes.** Already references the main agreement generically — works with both the old and new contract structure.
