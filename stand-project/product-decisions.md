# Stand — Product Decisions

Decisions that need Lauren's sign-off. Update status as decisions are made.

## P0 — Need before we start building

- [ ] **Final business categories + subcategories** — sign off on the Alex/Petra branching doc (stand-platform-branching.xlsx). The 6 categories are set (Sports, Toys & Games, Fashion & Style, Cats & Dogs, Beauty & Design, Cooking + Other). Subcategories and products are mapped per age group (8-12 and 12-15). Near finalized — review with Lauren.
- [ ] **Printify product catalog** — the branching doc already maps which products use Printify. Proposed starting set for the pilot (review with Lauren):
  1. T-Shirts (Fashion → Clothing) — both age groups
  2. Sweatshirts (Fashion → Clothing) — both age groups
  3. Posters & Artwork (Beauty → Home Decor)
  4. Backpacks (Fashion → Bags)
  5. Decorated Makeup Bags (Beauty → Makeup)
  6. Dog Bandanas (Cats & Dogs → Dogs)
  7. Hair Bows & Scrunchies (Sports → Dance & Gym / Fashion → Accessories)
  8. Dance Bags (Sports → Dance & Gym)

  Other Printify products in the doc (golf balls, polos, sneakers/crocs, candles, tie-dyed washcloths, cat collar charms) are more niche — add if Lauren wants them.
- [ ] **Coach voice/tone** — how does the Stand Coach talk to kids? Hype-y? Chill? Encouraging teacher? Sets the copy tone for the entire onboarding.
- [ ] **Parent gate flow** — does the kid hand the device to mom, or does mom get an email link? Very different builds.

## P1 — Need before the feature gets built

- [ ] **Vibe/style options** — how many brand kits, what are they called? ("Fun & Colorful", "Cool & Minimal", etc.) Maps directly to Recraft style presets for logo generation.
- [ ] **Age-specific differences** — what changes between 8-11 and 11-14 cohorts? Simpler product options? Different copy tone?
- [ ] **Survey questions** — exact copy for the 3-4 parent gate questions (value prop resonance, pricing reaction, biggest concern, attribution).
- [ ] **Service business storefront** — for non-product businesses (dog walking, pet sitting), what shows up? A rate? A contact method? A booking link?
- [ ] **Pricing positioning** — "For Everyone" / "Sweet Spot" / "Extra Special" — what are the actual dollar amounts kids set for their products?

## P2 — Need before polish, not blocking

- [ ] **Grand Reveal specifics** — Lauren said "more interactive, come to life, fun moments." What does that mean? Confetti? Sound? Animation sequence?
- [ ] **Brand card content** — what info goes on the shareable card? Logo + name + URL? Products too?
- [ ] **Parent non-approval handling** — if the parent doesn't approve, does the kid's progress save and wait? Expire after X days?
- [ ] **Storefront duplicate handling** — what if two kids pick the same business name? Auto-suffix? Force unique names?
