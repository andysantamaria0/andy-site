# Goals & Accountability — Brainstorm

Since the storefront and marketplace are showcase landing pages (not fully transactional) for the pilot, the goals section on the CEO Dashboard should be **manually driven** — accountability and encouragement milestones, not automated sales tracking.

## Goal Ideas (kid checks these off)

- "I pitched my parent or family member for the first time!"
- "I pitched my teacher and got feedback!"
- "I practiced my pitch with my Stand Coach today!"
- "I showed my storefront to a friend!"
- "I got my first pre-order!"
- "I came up with a new product idea!"
- "I updated my business name or brand!"
- "I set a savings goal for what I'll do with my earnings!"

## Design Thinking

- These are feel-good momentum builders, not KPIs
- The kid taps to check them off — celebration animation, confetti, coach praise
- Could unlock badges or visual rewards on the dashboard
- Stand Coach could suggest new goals based on what the kid has done
- Parents see the goal progress when the kid shows them the dashboard (the "turn the screen around" moment)
- Eventually these become a mix of manual + automated (real sales, real orders) once the storefront is live

## Post-Pilot Evolution

- Connect to real sales data when marketplace goes transactional
- Leaderboards across Stand CEOs (social features sprint)
- Parent-set goals ("earn $50 before summer")
- Streak tracking ("3 days in a row practicing your pitch")
