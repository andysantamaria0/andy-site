# Linear Integration & Sprint Transparency

## The Idea

Once the PRD is locked and the sprint starts, set up Linear so Lauren has a live view into progress. She should be able to see what's being worked on, what's done, and what's next — without having to ask.

## Why This Matters

- Builds trust: she can see the work happening in real time
- Reduces async check-in overhead ("what's the status?")
- The commit/PR trail naturally shows the volume and intensity of work
- Subtly demonstrates that this is way more than 40 hours/week — the timestamps, commit frequency, and PR throughput tell that story without having to say it

## What She Sees

- Linear board with tickets organized by milestone (matches the sprint milestones in the proposal)
- Each ticket shows status: backlog → in progress → done
- GitHub integration: commits and PRs linked to tickets automatically
- Daily progress visible — she can check in anytime and see movement
- Milestone completion markers that match the proposal checkpoints

## Setup

- Create Linear workspace/project for Stand
- Integrate with GitHub repo (auto-link commits/PRs to tickets)
- Give Lauren viewer access
- Organize tickets by milestone (Design System, Architecture, Coach Onboarding, Marketplace, Dashboard, Polish, Ship)
- Consider a simple dashboard or weekly summary email

## Timing

- Set up Linear after PRD is locked, before Day 1
- Pre-populate tickets from the PRD so the board is ready on sprint start
- Could be part of the "Pre-Sprint" milestone deliverable
