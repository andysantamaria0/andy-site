# Stand — Service Accounts

Accounts Lauren needs to create and share via 1Password with Andy and David. These are the production accounts that will own the Stand infrastructure.

## Already Set Up

- [x] **GitHub** — Repo created at github.com/andysantamaria0/stand-app (private). Will transfer to Lauren's account after sprint. David invited as admin.

## Domain

- [ ] **standkids.com** — Who owns this? Needs to be pointed at Vercel for storefront hosting. If Lauren owns it, add Andy as a collaborator on the DNS provider (or share credentials).

## Notes

- Lauren should create a shared email like admin@standkids.com for account ownership
- All credentials should go in a shared 1Password vault
- Andy and David need access before Day 1
