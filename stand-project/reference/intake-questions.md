# Stand Intake Questionnaire

## I. Vision & Product

Let's start with the big picture. I want to understand your dream for Stand — in your words.

**What is the one sentence you'd use to describe Stand to a parent?**
Kids are curious, creative, and purpose-driven by nature - STAND gives them the tools to turn that into a real business, all while learning skills that will last a lifetime. It's a platform for your child to create, build, and grow their own business — from dreaming up their brand to bringing it to life, earning real money, and evolving every step of the way.


**What does success look like 6 months from now?**

We had a successful launch in LA / locally this summer, have hosted physical STAND events and have onboarding our first 1000 customers by the end of summer. We will use this closed pilot to further validate the product experience before our broader launch.

**And 12 months from now?**

We have proven retention metrics of our original cohorts, , have reached 10,000 customers, launched across other key markets, and built a community of stand CEOS.

**What age range are you targeting? (For the pilot)**
Two cohorts - 8-11 and 11- 14 as the demos.

**What does a kid's "first win" look like in the app?**

Choosing a business idea that excited them and seeing their brand come to life visually — the business card, the storefront preview, their name on products. The moment they realize "wow, I can actually do this." It needs to feel like magic, and a fun game not like filling out a form. Unlock that aha storefront moment and feeling like its real.

## II. Where Things Are Today

Help me understand where things stand right now. No wrong answers — just a snapshot.

**What do you have built today?**
*Prototype, designs, branding assets, pitch deck, etc.*
Functional prototype built by Chris on Claude Code — Next.js/React on Supabase, deployed on Vercel. Has onboarding flow (interests → business idea → brand creation → parent approval via QR/email). Voice input was attempted. Some Figma work from Devin on brand evolution – not good yet. Original Stand brand/logo exists. Summer beta tested physical elements of CEO kits.
Investor deck.


**What's working well in the current prototype? What isn't?**
The general flow - QR code, basics.
What's not working: Looks "vibe coded" — not branded or polished. Category selection is overwhelming (too many options). The reveal moment doesn't deliver excitement. Missing the magic/animation kids expect. Onboarding feels too long/ redudant. Logo AI generation has quality/spelling issues. Design feels AI-generated, missing soul. Not giving the magical feel we are going for yet and doesn't feel interactive.

## III. Business & Compliance

A few questions about the business side. These help me design with the right constraints from day one.

**For the pilot, will kids be handling real money? Or will transactions be simulated at first?**

No. Here is scope for pilot:
Build and run a digital, product-like pilot to validate and refine the core STAND experience before building a full fledged MVP. This includes: kid onboarding + personalization, business/category demand, value prop resonance and positioning, pricing.

A) Onboarding + Personalization (the kid experience)
We will determine:
Which steps create the most excitement and completion


Which personalization levers matter most and if there are any critical missing components:


interests → business idea selection


brand vibe/colors/name


logos style


launch plan + goal setting ?


reveal output (brand/business rendering) - must be magical + fun moment! Prove the value of STAND!


Success looks like:


Recommended MVP onboarding flow & "must-have" personalization set


B) Business Categories + Demand
We will determine:
Top business categories kids choose and why (fun, ease, DIY vs resale vs services)


Any differences by demographics (age bands, gender etc?).
Success looks like:
Clear recommendation of top ~4 "business areas" for MVP focus


C) Value Prop + Pricing Sensitivity (parent-only)
We will determine:
Which value prop framing produces highest intent + completion
What pricing structure resonates
Biggest objections / moments of friction driving drop-off or hesitation to purchase (theoretical, not actually charging)


Success looks like:
Directional A/B read on value prop + pricing sensitivity summary + launch hypotheses


Recommended parent messaging and parent gate flow improvements
D) Motivations / Dashboard / Gamification Hypotheses
We will explore:
What motivates kids most about STAND:income, gamifications, community? badges vs goals/streaks vs. personal or specific goals/ moments  (save, spend , give) vs. community (w/friends, etc)


Success looks like:
Ranked motivational mechanics (their 'why) + MVP dashboard recommendations (the how we will meet their motivations for MVP).


Key Components of Digital Pilot
Landing Pages (A/B)
landing page with  value prop variants to A/B test


CTA language aligned to STAND?  "Be part of our earliest STAND CEOs — and get your first STAND on us when we launch." - First 50 to complete?


Kid Onboarding Web Prototype (5–10 minutes)
Flow (ideal):
 About you → interests (pick up to 3) → biz idea generator → name → brand vibe/colors → logo/icons/emojis → launch plan → goal → reveal
Mobile-first UI; fast, tile-based decisions


"Reveal" outputs a shareable brand/business card is ideal.


Parent Gate (Consent + Minimal Info) & Parent Module
Parent/guardian consent flow with COPPA-aware language


Minimal fields: parent email, kid age band, optional gender, consent checkbox


Routes into kid onboarding  (?) determine where in flow…


Captures: parent resonance, objections, and pricing sensitivity (theoretical, no charge)


Deliverables →
Landing page (A/B)


Parent gate & section


Kid onboarding web prototype


Any analytics + export access


Key learnings:


Must-have onboarding steps + personalization winners


Top 4 business areas for kids businesses + "why"


Value prop A/B directional winner + messaging recommendations


Pricing sensitivity summary + launch hypotheses


Key objections + proposed fixes


Optional: gamification preference findings - not a must have…


In summary: Run a digital, product-like pilot  to validate the core STAND experience before building MVP.  This will include: kid onboarding + personalization,  business/category demand, value prop resonance, and parent conversion / pricing sensitivity. We are targeting ~100 families for our initial outreach.  This will be a closed pilot to start with potential to go broader, if needed.

## IV. Design & Brand

This is where it gets fun. I want to build something you're genuinely proud to show people.

**How would you describe Stand's personality in 3 words?**
Cool / Relevant, Elevated (not a kids toy brand), and grounded in nostalgia

**Are there apps or products you admire for their design?**
*Doesn't have to be in education.*

Uncommon (unc.mn) — simplicity, clarity, Apple-esque. Tin Can (tincan.kids) — nostalgia modernized beautifully. Double Good — gamification, leaderboards, pop-up selling concept. Girl Scouts as a structural inspiration. Gaming aesthetics married with soul.  Make badges made cool again, streetwear/hype.grounded in nostalgia but fresh / relevant.
Legos - because, well lego! Relevant partnerships, grows with kids,  timeless
Greenlight for parent trust / functionality
Roblux for gaming system / retention / credits
A24 productions - amazing viral marketing, branding, cultural relevant on point!



**How important is mobile vs desktop for your users?**
- Mobile-first – ipads a must!
- Desktop-first
- Equal priority

## V. Working Together

Last one. Let's figure out how we work best together.

**What's your ideal timeline for having something live that users can touch?**
Need this ready to test within two weeks!
