# Stand — Designer Asset Brief

*Feb 20, 2026*

We're building a kid entrepreneurship app where kids (ages 8-14) go through an onboarding experience, build a brand, and get a live storefront with real products. The design should feel elevated, wholesome, and cool — not childish, not "AI-sloppy," no emojis. Think: Girl Scouts meets streetwear meets Wes Anderson. The existing brand (logo, palette, fonts) is the foundation — these assets extend it.

## Priority 1 — Need by end of Week 1 (Feb 28)

### Category Icons (6 + Other)

One icon per business category. Hand-illustrated style, consistent stroke weight.

1. **Sports** — sneaker, ball, headband, athletic gear — active, bold
2. **Toys & Games** — dice, magic wand, game controller, slime — playful, fun
3. **Fashion & Style** — thread, needle, fabric swatch, accessories, handbag — stylish, elevated
4. **Cats & Dogs** — paw print, dog, cat, leash, pet bowl — friendly, not cartoonish
5. **Beauty & Design** — paintbrush, palette, lip gloss, candle — creative, polished
6. **Cooking** — whisk, oven mitt, cupcake, mixing bowl — something warm and inviting
7. **Other / Custom** — lightbulb, spark, question mark — open-ended, inviting

These are the main entry points in the onboarding. They need to feel approachable for an 8-year-old and cool enough for a 13-year-old.

### Business Action Icons (8)

Used throughout the app — onboarding, storefront, sharing:

1. **Money/Earnings** — for goal setting and margin display
2. **Share/Send** — for sharing brand card and storefront link
3. **Star/Badge** — for achievements and milestones
4. **Shopping Bag** — for product display on storefront
5. **Paintbrush/Palette** — for the "pick your style" moment
6. **Coach/Guide** — megaphone or speech bubble, for the onboarding coach
7. **Lock/Shield** — for the parent gate and safety
8. **Sparkle/Magic** — for the grand reveal moment

## Priority 2 — Need by mid-Week 2 (Mar 3)

### Badge/Stamp Set (6)

Earned badges that feel like Boy Scout patches, varsity letters, or wax seals. These are rewards kids collect during onboarding and beyond.

1. **"CEO"** — you've started your business
2. **"First Business"** — onboarding complete
3. **"Brand Builder"** — picked your style and colors
4. **"Goal Setter"** — set a savings/earnings goal
5. **"Ready to Launch"** — storefront is live
6. **"Shared My Business"** — sent your brand card to someone

### Vibe/Style Tiles (4)

Each represents a brand kit the kid can choose during onboarding. These are visual mood board thumbnails (roughly 200x200px) that immediately communicate the aesthetic:

1. **Sweet & Sparkle** — warm, pastel, friendly, soft gradients
2. **Street & Bold** — urban, high-contrast, hype culture, clean lines
3. **Chill & Nature** — earth tones, organic textures, calm, grounded
4. **Retro & Fun** — vintage, playful, nostalgic, hand-drawn feel

### Animation Assets (if motion is in scope)

- **Confetti burst** — plays during the grand reveal moment
- **Badge unlock** — a stamp or seal landing on a card with a satisfying thud
- **Progress fill** — smooth progress bar animation
- **Sparkle/glow** — subtle effect on the live build pane as things update in real time

---

## Priority 3 — Nice to Have (anytime during sprint)

### Storefront Decorative Elements

- A **"Coming Soon"** banner or ribbon for storefronts without payments yet
- A **"Kid-Made"** or **"Handmade"** stamp/seal
- Corner decorations or border treatments for the shareable brand card
- A simple tileable pattern or texture for backgrounds

---

## Format & Technical Specs

- **SVG preferred** — scales perfectly, and we can recolor programmatically with the design system
- **PNG with transparent background** as fallback (2x resolution minimum)
- **Monochrome/single-color delivery** — we'll apply brand colors in code, so deliver in black or a neutral tone
- **Consistent stroke weight** across all icons in a set
- **Size range:** should look clean at 32px (small UI) and 128px+ (feature moments)
- **No emojis, no clip art, no stock illustration style** — hand-drawn or custom illustrated only

---

## Brand Context

- **Existing logo:** Stand wordmark in 3 variants (Black, Blank Slate, Founder Red)
- **Existing palette:** Provided separately (Stand Color Palette 2.pdf)
- **Tone:** Wholesome but real. DIY, community-oriented. Not "little capitalist kids hawking crap." Think: the best summer camp you ever went to, but for building businesses.
- **Design references Lauren has cited:** Uncommon Goods, Tin Can Studio, Double Good, Girl Scouts, Legos, A24 films, Roblox, Greenlight app, Wes Anderson
