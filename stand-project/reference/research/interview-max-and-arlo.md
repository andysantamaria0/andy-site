# Kid Interview: Max & Arlo

## Demographics
- **Max**: Age 14, 8th grade, Crossroads
- **Arlo**: Age 11, 5th grade, Crossroads *(way more into the cookie idea — feels like the prime age)*

---

## Product Thoughts

**What they would want to sell:**
- Cool custom phone cases
- Personalized patches
- Private label situation
- Browse pre-built options: "I want to make my own type of company versus a cookie. Can there be pre-built options I can choose from?"
- Older kids want commission, private label distribution sites, very bespoke requests for this demo
- Printify — example of a site they've used to make their own merch in the past

**Content & Learning:**
- Would love a write-up of 'how to' and videos for content

**Personalization is critical:**
- Super important for kids to have their own branding — "the Max cookie sticker in the corner"
- Max wants it to feel like the brand is his
- Idea: Send people little cookies that are different flavors, then they pick flavors, then they choose

## How They'd Sell

- Online mostly but some farmers market and IRL

---

## Payment Thoughts

- Apple Cash as an option
- Would want a portal to see how much money you've made, cash out or gift card
- They would expect it costs an upfront setup / CEO box fee and then monthly to host — $20-30

---

## Key Appeal

- Really found the appeal in having everything in one place
- Dealing with the logistics of the product and having another company handle it

---

## Key Questions / Concerns

- How to keep the kids engaged consistently versus losing interest — needs gamification
- Their friends have tried their own side hustles and it doesn't last long because of loss of interest or too hard to manage logistics
