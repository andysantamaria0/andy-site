## Parent Perspective (Simone)

- Wants to teach them about money
- Would only want to spend 5 minutes a day / 20 minutes a week on this
- Most interesting: teaching kids responsibility, value of money, fundamentals of business, and seeing them get excited around working
- OK with technology, just not social media forward
- "Just don't want them dealing with toxic or dangerous things, but pretty open to any products"
