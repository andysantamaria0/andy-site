# Stand — Shared Links & Assets

## Reference Sites

### Uncommon (unc.mn)
https://www.unc.mn/
- Design platform for founders — brand, site, deck, all in one
- Very Apple-coded, clean, minimal
- **Lauren's take (02-17 call):** "It's kind of like Stand, but for like anyone... I liked the simplicity of it and like brand logo website. Like it was just so clear what you were getting. Can we do something inspired by that for kids?"
- **What she likes:** Simplicity, clarity of value prop, Apple-esque design

### Tin Can (tincan.kids)
https://tincan.kids/
- WiFi landline phone for kids — "all talk, no smarts"
- Nostalgic rotary phone reimagined, warm golden yellow palette, retro charm
- $100 device, $9.99/month for calling regular numbers
- **Lauren's take (02-17 call):** Referenced as an example of brands "taking the nods of nostalgia and utilizing" them for kids in a modern way
- **What she likes:** The nostalgia-to-modern concept, the execution of making something old feel cool again

### Sticker Robot (stickerobot.com)
https://stickerobot.com/
- Custom vinyl sticker printing, die-cut stickers, roll labels
- Orange/white palette, professional but creative
- Lauren mentioned a "Sticker Bot" device in the 02-17 call — possibly a different product (a physical device kids talk into to generate stickers). Sticker Robot may be relevant as a potential product partner for Stand's marketplace (custom stickers as a kid business type)

### Double Good (doublegood.com)
https://www.doublegood.com/
- Virtual fundraising platform — sell gourmet popcorn through 4-day pop-up stores
- Vibrant orange/purple/blue, playful, mobile-first
- Groups keep 50% of revenue, no upfront costs
- Average group raises $3,000+
- **Lauren's take (02-17 call):** "It's like a fundraising platform that kids kind of like Girl Scouts... a GoFundMe for kids thing... I think it's a good thing to look into as like sort of interesting kind of user-face comp... there's a lot of like leaderboard features and things that gamify it a little, make it fun."
- **What she likes:** User-facing experience as a comp, leaderboard features, gamification, pop-up concept (time-boxed selling), sharing mechanics

### Stand Prototype (Chris's build)
https://stand-app-omega.vercel.app/
- Current prototype built by Chris on Claude Code
- Next.js/React app, Supabase backend, deployed on Vercel
- Has onboarding flow: choose interests → narrow business idea → create brand (name, colors, logo style) → voice input → pitch to parents → parent approval via QR/email
- **Lauren's assessment:** "Lovable vibes" / "vibe coded" — functional but not production-ready, needs real branding and polish

### Packy McCormick — "16 Lessons on Selling (and Life) from My 5-Year-Old"
https://x.com/packym/status/2015059560403267958
- Full article saved to: `packy-mccormick-article.md`
- Packy McCormick (Not Boring newsletter) writes about his 5-year-old son Dev selling "Donut Hats" (Play-Doh rings wrapped in tape) at a Brooklyn playground
- Dev created a business plan, figured out pricing/margins/target market, handled rejection, iterated on feedback, made his first sales
- The kid naturally created a "Setback List" — a feedback loop of lessons from each customer interaction
- **Lauren's take (02-17 call):** "If you look at this, like this is what's happening right now. And it's all like with parents helping their kids do it." — Evidence of the cultural moment/trend
- **Why it matters for Stand:** This is the organic, unstructured version of exactly what Stand wants to systematize. The emotional arc (nervous → rejection → first sale → hooked) IS the promise delivery. Dev's insight "Kids want the Donut Hats, the parents have all the money" is literally Stand's dual-customer problem stated by a 5-year-old.
- **Andy's note:** "Not really getting it but I feel like if you're a parent this could resonate more" — correct, this is the parent emotional hook

## Lauren's Design Preferences (from both calls)

### What she LIKES:
- Nostalgia modernized (badges, old-school concepts made cool)
- Wes Anderson aesthetic
- "80s sort of" vibe
- Elevated, not too young/juvenile
- Simplicity (like Uncommon/Apple)
- Gaming-inspired elements but married with soul/nostalgia
- Interactive and playful
- Icons and illustration-driven
- Black as a potential color
- "Build your own" feeling
- Fun but professional
- Old tennis poster vibe
- Vintage badges made cool again
- Streetwear/hype aesthetic option

### What she DOESN'T like:
- Primary colors (too juvenile, "skewed way too young")
- AI-generated looking design ("AI-y," "Canva-y")
- Generic/soulless design
- Too many options overwhelming kids
- Things that feel like they had no real effort
- The current Figma work from her designer Dennis ("feels like he just didn't put any real effort towards this," "missing some like the soul")

### Key quote:
"We need to be something kids feel like they're a part of that feels cool and relevant. But we also don't want to be too heavy handed and that it takes away from their brand, their experience, their business products that they're building on Stand."
