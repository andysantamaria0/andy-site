## I. My Background

A product leader for the last 12 years working with early-stage startups. Early employee at Square where I ran beta products as an associate product manager. These products went on to become huge business lines like Cash App, Retail, and Square Capital (small business loans). Led a pilot with the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission to install Square hardware in taxis (before Uber was allowed). Recently was the head of product at a Web3 infra startup with a custodial trust license serving institutional and retail investors with low risk tolerance. During the fallout from FTX, along with the head of engineering, was tasked with a drastic turnaround with only 10 months of runway left. Rebuilt an entirely new product and got the company acquired (the software was the key asset).

After that started a small venture studio where my partner from the previous company worked with many founders at the earliest stages, right before they were starting to build software. Helped them with feature planning, wireframing, PRDs, and roadmapping (the old-school way!).

Currently consulting with Fractal Tech NYC — an AI engineering accelerator. Act as Founder in Residence, working to bridge the frontier of AI engineering application to startups looking to grow by building faster and smarter. Built partnerships with Antler, Collab Fund, two pre-seed firms, and in initial talks with Forum Ventures.

## II. David Shimel, Engineering Leader

15+ years of software engineering experience. 8 years at Google (Docs/Sheets/Slides, AR ads for YouTube, Lens on Image Search). Led engineering at Atmosfy (TikTok-meets-Yelp consumer app) through their $13M raise with Redpoint Ventures. Backend engineer at Stripe on their Capital product (lending systems). Now at Fractal Tech as engineering coach and AI researcher.

Also an entrepreneur — runs a music education company with $20k+ revenue, 100+ students, monetized YouTube channel.

## III. Portfolio — Things Built End to End

### Job Detective Jr.
Automated custom data pipeline crawling 8+ ATS services and 5 websites, two-way syncing with Fractal's HubSpot. Custom regex filtering for curated job lists. Discord bot for updates.

### The Hiring Spa
Personalized job matching for engineers. Engineers sign up with GitHub, resume, portfolio. Guided questionnaire produces "EngineerDNA" table. Matching engine crawls job descriptions, company LinkedIn, and websites. Gets better with each engagement. ~100 users.

### Vialoure (for Andy's Friends)
Private concierge center for group travel. Focus on: centralized trip management (members, expenses, schedules) and beautiful, stylish, evocative design. Every detail from fonts to animations tells a consistent story.

### Other: Fractal Tech Website, Partner Portal, Backend Admin Portal

## IV. The Approach

**Key concepts:**
- **Operating rhythm** — the working cadence
- **Basecamp** — where Stand is now (funded, prototype, branding, direction but unclear path)
- **Promise Delivery** — the moment the customer gets what they came for
- Two main customer groups: parents and their kids (law as an emerging subgroup)
- Promise Delivery can be different for each parent — uncovered through user feedback
- Process: Decide on Promise Delivery > Build > Talk to customers > Iterate

## V. The Phases

1. **Alignment** — Roles clear, expectations set, highest-level goals illuminated
2. **Design (Systems, Services, Functionality)** — System architecture enabling speed, flexibility, production-grade security. Key constraints: COPPA compliance + payment rails (Square/Ponto experience)
3. **Product Engineering (Building)** — Start with product document (what we're building, who the customers are, the promise). Then user journeys.
4. **Front-End Interactive** — Visualized and interactive app functionality, rapid iteration
5. **Live + Testing** — Production testing, testing parties (in-person intense sessions)
6. **User Feedback** — Share product, async feedback, live in-person recorded sessions

## VI. Estimates

| Role | Rate |
|------|------|
| Engineering Leader (David Shimel) | $300/hr |
| Product Engineer (Andy Santamaria) | $85/hr |

| Phase | Who | Hours | Cost |
|-------|-----|-------|------|
| Alignment Sessions | Both | ~2 hr | Waived |
| System Design + Config | Engineering Leader | ~5-10 hr | $1,500-$3,000 |
| Initial Product Document | Product Engineer | ~1-2 hr | $85-$170 |

**Ongoing (Building, Testing, Feedback):** Flexible — 10-hour sprints with check-ins.

**Example Week 1:** $2,435-$4,105 (both roles)
**Example Week 2:** $850 (product engineer only)
